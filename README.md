## Historical Context

The Pontus region (Εύξεινος Πόντος) represents one of the most significant areas of Hellenic civilization outside mainland Greece. From the establishment of Miletian colonies in the 8th century BCE to the population exchange of 1923, Greek communities thrived along the Black Sea coast and interior Anatolia for nearly three millennia.
